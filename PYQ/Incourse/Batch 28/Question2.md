## Question 2
### 2(a)

Explain the difference and relationship between a weak and a strong entity set.

### Answer:

A strong entity set has a primary key and can exist independently. A weak entity set lacks a primary key and depends on a strong entity for identification. Weak entities are linked to strong entities through an identifying relationship, and use a partial key combined with the strong entity's key to form a unique identifier.
